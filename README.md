# Bit Space Development Ltd

Bit Space Development is a web startup based out of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The focus of the company is on custom web applications and services particularly with the purpose of gamifing education. Bit Space Development is made up of passionate people who are veterans in the field, community leaders, and passionate developers. There is no room for error when it comes to education so we take this seriously.

Bit Space Development also works with small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and artists to help them with their web site, design, branding, and marketing. This is where we are able to make the most impact for our clients. The services we offer are designed for these clients to be able to easily scale to having their own IT department and take over, but until then we are able to provide them with full IT coverage from consulting to web development.

## Mission

Bit Space Development is driven to build services that will make a difference, not just another tool to make money. We value collaboration over competition. We value open source over proprietary. We are not driven by profit and we above all else embrace innovation over tradition.

Our mission is to develop the best learning experiences to help people learn in effective ways. We are developing solutions to bring education to the people who need it most and we are building the tools to make this easier.

## Community

We are made up of community leaders. Bit Space Development helps manage and organize multiple local developer meetup groups including the Winnipeg Android user group. The community is important and we are working to bring the developer communities together to help build innovation and collaboration. We give 1% of our product and time back to the community.

## Students

We are committed to providing work experience for students in the field. We are currently working with International students to help build experiences that they can take with them back to their home countries.

Bit Space Development is committed to developing a meaningful and constructive environment for our students. We work in an agile environment to help students develop real technical and people skills that they will be able to use with us or another employer in the future.
